  <h3>Bakery Boxes</h3>
  <body>
    <p>
      Our Bakery Boxes are released monthly and are comprised of a variety of
      baked goods. The menu for these boxes changes each month. Orders for our
      boxes typically open at the end of each month and are delivered three
      weeks after the order form closes. The prices for boxes change based on
      the contents, but they can typically range from $30 to $85. We do not
      accept edits to our boxes; however, please notify us of any allergies, and
      we will accomodate as much as possible.
    </p>
